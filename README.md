# Neural Networks @ FIIT

This repository contains supporting materials for the subject __Neural Networks__.

It is a very important repository, where you will find the asisgnments prepared for you, for the first 4 weeks of the semester.

##  Week 1
This is a warm-up week and for some of you the __lecture is after your seminar__, so we'll take it easy on you. 
All you have to do is to prepare your computing environment. 
If you have never worked with Python, this is a good chance for you to start - you'll be using it a lot during this semester (or not, if you prefer C++).
We have prepared a few simple tasks that you can find in the directory "week_1" - Jupyter Notebook.
If you know all of that already, well than, congratulations ;)

But still... the attendance of the seminars is mandatory.

Regards, L.

## Week 2
All hands on board!

This week, you are going to implement a simple (naive) multilayer perceptron.
In the notebook, there are already prepared base classes and structures. Define the class Neuron and Dense Layer with all the necessary parameters they require. Implement simple feed forward function. The weakness of Rosenblatt's perceptron was it's linearity. Make the linear Neuron Layers' output into non-linear by adding non-linear activation functions (the ones that are declared).

Of course - you don't have to do it before the seminar... 
As stated during the lecture and seminars, this will be your work for the upcoming week's seminars.

Good luck,
see ya

Regards, L.
